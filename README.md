### Hello World! 🌏

I am Isheta Bhatt, aka IshyFishy, and I'm a second year CSE student! My main goal for this Git account is to simply have a pretty 'neat' archive of my codes, since I'm notorious for:

      ☐ a.) coding away a lot
      
      ☐ b.) being incredibly impatient with backups
      
      ☐ c.) losing all my code
      
      ☐ d.) crying about said lost code
      
      ☑️ e.) all of the above (in the given order, no less) 
     
I'm currently solving Steven-Felix-Suhendry's CP4 book on Kattis, making it a point to solve about 4 problems a day between college and commute hours - in C/C++, Java and Python - as a way to revise each language daily. Also because I love puzzles >:D 

Well versed in HTML/CSS, I'm also delving into the world of UNIX and loving it so much to the point of distrohopping every half year or so. My distro arsenal consists of Zorin OS (my first distro, I look back at it so fondly), a breeze of Linux Mint, Fedora Nobara, Kali Linux, Pop OS and currently Fedora Silverblue. This has helped me appreciate the beauty of open source software and the community behind the same. 

I consider myself a very quick learner which helps me grasp new concepts (and software) quite easily. I've also worked as a freelance writer in the past, where I was to research on very niche topics and present coherently drafted articles on the same.

My hobbies include:
    📚 Reading and writing
    📝 Sudoku
    🎮 Gaming
    🎶 Exploring music and obsessively creating suspiciously specific playlists
    🎨 Crafting
    🍲 Cooking
    
I'm also a fan of learning up cool traits because I'd randomly be obsessed with the idea of being good at them. Because of this, I ended up teaching myself calligraphy, ASL, Morse code and the Cyrillic script, and am currently (trying to) practice up a bunch of magic tricks to impress my 8-year-old nephew.
