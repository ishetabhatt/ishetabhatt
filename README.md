# Hello World! 🌏


### What this account is for

I am Isheta Bhatt and I'm a second year CSE student! My main goal for this Git account is to simply have a pretty 'neat' archive of my codes, since I'm notorious for:

      ☐ a.) coding away a lot
      
      ☐ b.) being incredibly impatient with backups
      
      ☐ c.) losing all my code
      
      ☐ d.) crying about said lost code
      
      ☑️ e.) all of the above (in the given order, no less) 


### What I'm doing currently

I'm currently solving Steven-Felix-Suhendry's CP4 book on Kattis, making it a point to solve about 4 problems a day between college and commute hours - in **C/C++**, **Java** and **Python** - as a way to revise each language daily. Also because I love puzzles >:D

Well-versed in **HTML/CSS**, I'm also delving into the world of **UNIX** and loving it so much to the point of distro-hopping every half year or so. My distro arsenal consists of Zorin OS (my first distro, I look back at it so fondly), a breeze of Linux Mint, Fedora Nobara, Kali Linux, Pop OS and currently Fedora Silverblue. This has helped me appreciate the beauty of open-source software and the community behind the same.

I consider myself a very quick learner which helps me grasp new concepts (and software) quite easily. I've also worked as a freelance writer in the past, where I was to research very niche topics and present coherently drafted articles on the same.


### My hobbies

This list is incomplete.  <sup> I will get around to </sup> ~~You can help by~~ expanding it. <br />
      📚 Reading and writing <br />
      📝 Sudoku <br />
      🎮 Gaming <br />
      🎨 Crafting <br />
      🍲 Cooking <br />
      🎶 Exploring music and obsessively creating suspiciously specific playlists <br />
<br />
I'm also a fan of learning cool traits because I'd randomly be obsessed with the idea of being good at them. Because of this, I ended up teaching myself calligraphy, ASL, Morse code, swing dancing and the Cyrillic script, and am currently (trying to) practice up a bunch of magic tricks to impress my 8-year-old nephew.
