### Hello World! 🌏

I am Isheta Bhatt, aka IshyFishy, and I'm a second year CSE student! My main goal for this Git account is to simply have a pretty 'neat' archive of my codes, since I'm notorious for:
      ☐ a.) coding away a lot
      ☐ b.) being incredibly impatient with backups
      ☐ c.) losing all my code
      ☐ d.) crying about said lost code
      ☑️ e.) all of the above (in the given order, no less) 
      
I'm currently solving Steven-Felix-Suhendry's CP4 book on Kattis, making it a point to solve about 4 problems a day between college and commute hours - in C/C++, Java and Python - as a way to revise each language daily. Also because I love puzzles >:D 

My hobbies include:
